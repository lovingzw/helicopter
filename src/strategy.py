    You are allowed to access the data(open, high, low, close, volume) of current minute,
    the current time, initial settings(initial cash and transaction cost).
    
    Notes:
    1. All data else you need in your model and strategy should be stored by yourself in 
    memory variable.
    
    2. Return value are limited to be in the following form: position_matrix_of_next_minute, 
    memory_list
    
    3. Backtest module will accept return values from your strategy function and use them as
    new input into your strateg function in next minute.
    
    4. Strategy functions that cannot operate properly in back test may ower your final grade.
    Please double check to make sure that your strategy function satisfy all the requirments above.
